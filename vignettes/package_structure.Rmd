```

```{r setup}
library(statficlassifications)
```

At the heart of the package are the functions for accessing the API in the file `functions_for_api_access.R`. Functions in this file should not use functions of this package. At the moment, `find_classification_service` uses `search_keys` and `search_classifications`. I guess such a recursion works since these functions set the argument `classification_service` and thus themselves do not rely on function `find_classification_service`. 

File `functions_for_api_search.R` provides the tools for searching and browsing available classifications and classification keys in the API. Functions in this file rely on functions in file `functions_for_api_access.R`.
